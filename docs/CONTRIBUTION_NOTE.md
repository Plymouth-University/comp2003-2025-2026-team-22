\# Contribution Note



This repository contains work completed by multiple team members as part of the COMP2003 group project.



Some early commits were made from a local development environment where the Git email contained a minor typo in the academic email address. The author name shown on those commits reflects the same contributor (Kate Adams-Leach).



All contributions are evidenced through:

\- commit content and timestamps

\- commit hashes referenced in the individual reflection appendix

\- supporting project documentation and meeting records



Subsequent commits use the correct Git configuration.
